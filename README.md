# 2 Knights Game

This is a maven 3 project made for Software Engineering Course. It follows the MVC pattern.

## Rules

Both players need to move their knights over the chessboard. After a move the previously affected tile will be inactive 
and neither of them can move their piece to that tile again. The player who made the last valid move will win.
